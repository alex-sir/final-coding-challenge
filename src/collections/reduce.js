/**
 * reduce(ray, cb, initialValue)
 * -----------------------------
 * Returns a single value created by invoking the callback function for
 * each item in the array. On each iteration the callback is invoked
 * with the result (starts as initialValue) and the current element.
 *
 * THIS ONLY NEEDS TO WORK FOR ARRAYS (but extra credit if you can make it work
 * with objects and strings. hint: use the forEach method you created)
 *
 * The result of invoking the callback is stored, and used for the next iteration.
 * Once all iterations are complete, reduce returns the final result.
